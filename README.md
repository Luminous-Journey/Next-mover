# Next-mover
I was too lazy to click the next button on webpages so i made a program to do it for me when i hit the right arrow key

The only file required to make it work is the [next_clicker.py](https://github.com/Luminous-Journey/Next-mover/blob/master/Next%20mover/next_clicker.py)
Dependencies are
-skicit-image
-numpy
-pyautogui
-keyboard
-pysimplegui
-windows(for os)
